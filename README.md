# GForge_chat_client

GForge chat client is a powerful chat bot framework built upon GForge NEXT platform. It integrates various components in GForge REST API to allow users to control the project management directly from the chat box.

Our chat client is unique in providing users with control over the components in the GForge NEXT platform. The chat bot can read messages in real-time, it follows through the conversation of the users. For example, whenever users are discussing about some issues with project progress, or talk about a new feature to be implemented, they can directly create a ticket from the terminal using a command like `/ticket summary:'calendar integration'`. Similarly, they can update a ticket using a command like`/update priority:1 id:27519`.
